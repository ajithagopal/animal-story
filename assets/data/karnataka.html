                    <p>The construction of reservoir, expansion of plantations, besides the railway line work and mini hydel power projects disturbed the wild elephants in parts of Hassan, Kodagu, Chikkamagaluru and Ramanagar districts.  </p>
                    <p>Around 80-90 wild pachyderms have been roaming in parts of Yeslru, Alur, Belur, Sakaleshpur and Arakalgud ranges of forest in Hassan district and Chikkamagaluru and Mudigere ranges in Chikkamagaluru district. The elephants in groups raid crops and tread into human habitats. </p>
                    <P>The conflict has intensified since the 1980s, when the Forest Department was forced to take up a large-scale operation to capture and translocate elephants for the first time in recent history. Since then, there have been many incidents of human deaths and the deaths of elephants as well. </P>
                    <p>Hundreds of people in villages in the affected area are constantly in fear as they may encounter elephants anywhere, at any point in time. Schoolchildren, plantation workers, planters, agricultural labourers, and travellers have suffered. Besides that, there were incidents when wild elephants were electrocuted to death as well. </p>
                    <h3>Conflict zones</h3>
                    <p class="conflict-zones">The villages on the foothills of the Western Ghats spread over Sakaleshpur, Alur, Belur, (all in Hassan division of forest) Chikkamagaluru and Mudigere (Chikkamagaluru division) taluks, parts of Kodagu district and Ramanagara district form the conflict zone. </p>
