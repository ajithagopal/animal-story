                    <p>Odisha ranks among the top five states in India for its elephant population, yet faces severe human-elephant conflicts, particularly impacting rural life in mineral-rich districts such as Dhenkanal, Angul, Keonjhar, and Sundargarh. </p>
                    <p>Elephants, typically long-ranging creatures, are displaced from their habitats primarily due to mining and infrastructure projects such as roads, railways, and canals. Dhenkanal stands at the heart of this conflict, with a staggering toll of 130 elephant and 227 human deaths over the past decade. </p>
                    <p>Additionally, rural areas grapple with significant crop-raiding by wild boars, prompting farmers to resort to electric fencing around their fields, unintentionally endangering elephants. In the last decade, 125 elephants have perished due to contact with live wires, with 83 electrocutions deemed deliberate and 42 accidental. </p>
                    <h3>Conflict zones</h3>
                    <p class="conflict-zones">Hindol, Sadar, Mahabirod, Kapilash and Sadangi forest range under Dhenkanal district. Bantala and Angul ranges of Angul districts. Champua, Keonjhar, Barbil and Telkoi ranges of Keonjhar. Bargaon, Kuanramunda, Panposh, Biramitrapur and Barsuan ranges of Sundargarh.</p>

As a part of community participation in conflict management, village level volunteers called ‘Gaja Saathi’ have been engaged in elephant conflict prone areas.</p>
