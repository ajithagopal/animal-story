                    <p>As the ghats runs throughout the western front of the State, human â€“ animal conflicts have increased over the past three decades with developmental activities. Agriculture, huge institutional buildings, new roads and quarrying along the forest fringes have blocked the century old migratory routes of elephants leading to conflict all around. Humans retaliate and the death of elephants by electrocution is also a serious cause of concern. Valparai plateau with its plantations and workforce lends itself to be a hotspot and conflict zone. In Nilgiris, the problem of plenty could have forced the big cats to venture out more into their past territories, now colonized by humans, another recipe for conflict. Wild boars constitute another menace in nearly a dozen districts as farmers want them to be shot for destroying their crops. In some districts, even peacocks are frowned upon by the farmers for the destruction to their crops. </p>
                    <h3>Conflict zones</h3>
                    <p class="conflict-zones">Gudalur in The Nilgiris, Valparai Plateau (Elephants, tigers and leopards), Coimbatore and Hosur Forest Divisions (Raiding crops and human habitations frequently).</p>
