                    <p>With the increasing penetration of humans in the forest areas through expanding cultivation, tiger reserves and wildlife sanctuary's decreasing forest area due to illegal possessions, dwindling prey base and overlapping needs have led to an increase in human - animal conflict in U.P., primarily the Terai region bordering Nepal. The reserves are not properly separated by a buffer zone. Dudhwa Tiger Reserve that stretches mainly across the Lakhimpur Kheri and Bahraich districts comprising of the Dudhwa National Park, Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary and Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary remains the hotspot of the conflict with the geography also contributing as the northern boundary of the park is flanked by the Mohana River flowing along the Indo-Nepal border while the Southern boundary is formed by the river Suheli. It is difficult for authorities to manage the migration of tigers and elephant herds from Nepal. The increasing instances of human-animal conflict forced U.P. to become the first State to declare death due to a man-animal conflict as a 'State-Declared Disaster', with a compensation of Rs. five lakhs to the deceased's family if the death takes place due to an attack by tiger, elephant and seven other wild animals.  </p>
                    <h3>Conflict zones</h3>
                    <p class="conflict-zones">Paliya, Nighasan, Gola blocks of Lakhimpur Kheri district, Powayan block of Shahjahanpur district, North Kheri, South Kheri and Shahjahanpur forest divisions (Tigers, Elephant, Wild Boars, Leopards, Rhinos). Lalaurikhera, Bisalpur,Puranpur and Marauri blocks in Pilibhit. </p>
