                    <p>Since the time of declaration of the Kawal Tiger Reserve in 2012, overwhelming human presence has been a source of human-animal conflict in this region. Absence of undisturbed corridor between the tiger reserves in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh and the Kawal Tiger Reserve in Telangana has resulted in several deaths of humans as well as tigers. Agriculture, mining and developmental works have had their role in broken stretches of forests, obstructing the migration route of the big cat. Kagaz Nagar and Asifabad divisions of the corridor area remain the hotspots of human-animal conflict in the state, with Khammam taking the next place with high presence of Gaur and other herbivores which keep destroying the crops. Black buck is the most detested animal in Narayanpet division, while wild boar has become a menace for crops in at least 13 districts in the state, along with other herbivores.  </p>
                    <!-- <p>Destruction of crops and houses, usually on traditional elephant areas, lead to fatalities on either side. The conflict is also interstate with corridors extending to Meghalaya, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh, and along the border with Bhutan. The 2023 Report on the Elephant Corridors of India said the country’s elephant corridors increased by 40% over 2010 to a total of 150. The northeastern States, primarily Assam, together have the most such corridors (48). Assam has four tiger reserves – Kaziranga, Manas, Nameri, and Orang – while Arunachal Pradesh has three (Kamlang, Namdapha, and Pakke) and Mizoram has the lone Dampa. There are hardly any reports of human - tiger conflicts in the region.</p> -->
